Why is python so cool?
When can I learn all the programming languages in the world/ go pro?
Why is there only finite time in life? (cuz if there was more time I wouldn't be
  concerned about the previous question) 
Can I write a python program to answer the previous question?
Whitespace scares me and I think I'm gonna make a bunch of python errors and my
  compy is gonna explode.
