In one of the videos, they were concatenating strings and had '1967' (or whatever) as a string, but then used the string method instead, saying they wanted to keep numbers as numbers.  Why?

In

# print some states
print '-' * 10
print "Michigan's abbreviation is: ", states['Michigan']
print "Florida's abbreviation is: ", states['Florida']

what does "print '-' * 10" mean?
